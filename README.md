<h2>TP-Link Easy Smart Switch port statistics</h2>

TP-Lnk Easy Smart switches are a family of managed swtiches cabable os fupporting QoS, VLANs and Link Agregation Groups (LAGs). 
They are managed through a web based interface, giving access a number of functions includic basic packets counters per-port. 
Unfortunately, these swtiches do not implement SNMP for access to these counters, nor do they appear to implement a discrete URL for
direct access to this information. This utility addresses this issue to produce per-port statistics from a single command line invoation 
with output that can be trivially parsed for formatted output, orentered into a monitoring system like Zabbix.
